    "A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a private, isolated network environment within a public cloud, such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure. It allows you to securely host and manage your resources, such as virtual machines, databases, and other services, with granular control over the network configuration.\n",

    "Key Features of a VPC\n",
    "Private and Isolated Environment:\n",
    "A VPC creates a logically isolated network space within the public cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customizable Networking:\n",
    "You can define your own IP address range, subnets, and network settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secure Communication:\n",
    "Traffic between resources within a VPC can be kept private, and internet access can be restricted or controlled through gateways and firewalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connectivity Options:\n",
    "VPCs can connect to on-premises data centers via secure VPNs, direct connections, or hybrid cloud setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firewall and Access Control:\n",
    "You can create security groups and network ACLs (Access Control Lists) to control inbound and outbound traffic.\n",
