    "You need a default constructor (constructor without any argument) in entities. This is needed because JPA/Hibernate uses the default constructor method to create a bean class using reflections. If you don't specify any constructor (nor Lombok annotation), Java will generate a default constructor (automatically generated by the compiler if no constructors have been defined for the class). But if you add a constructor with parameters (or @AllArgsConstructor), then you'll need to add a no args constructor (or @NoArgsConstructor) as well, for JPA/Hibernate to work. "
